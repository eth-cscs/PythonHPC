This will generate the CUDA code at the time when the decorator processes the function declaration and, therefore, we will avoid the runtime cost of JIT. Let's see how this is done:"

    "By default, memory allocated on the host is pageable. This means that it can be moved by the OS kernel to a secondary storage device if there is not enough memory available on the system. This can incur a significant performance penalty, especially if you write on freshly allocated memory (as it happens in our example). You can avoid this overhead by using *page-locked* or *pinned* memory. This memory cannot be paged out and it is physically resident on the memory device. CUDA gives you the opportunity to use pinned memory and Numba allows you to create pinned ndarrays using the [cuda.pinned_array()](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda-reference/memory.html#numba.cuda.pinned_array) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to keep track of which memory pages are resident on the physical memory and which are not, the OS kernel maintains a special data structure called *page table*. When you allocate memory on the host, the OS kernel simply creates a virtual memory mapping and it does not allocate any physical page. As soon as you start writing to the memory area you have been allocated, it will look for the page in its page tables and if not found, a *page fault* will be raised and then the kernel will have to physically allocate the missing memory page and update its page tables.\n",

In more complex codes or codes that you are not very familiar with, it would be good if this analysis could be done by a dedicated tool. Not to be misunderstood, understanding the code structure and its memory and compute requirements is essential for optimizing it in any case, but using a *performance profiler* is very handy for analyzing the performance bottlenecks, for helping you prioritizing your optimization targets and for understanding how much room for improvement exists.\n",

    "\n",
    "> You may install the Nvidia Visual Profiler on your personal computer and visualize the performance results, even if you don't have a GPU.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "srun -C gpu nvprof -o vecadd.nvprof python src/vecadd.py $((200*1000*1000))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you want to profile your code with `nvprof` you should call `cuda.profile_stop()` at the end of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This profiling provides basic information about the data transfers and the execution time of the different kernels. It is the first step you need to take, because this will show you how much time you spend on transferring data to/from the device and which kernels are the most time consuming. Here is a screenshot for our example:\n",

    "![Profiling of the vector addition benchmark](figs/vecadd-nvprof.png)\n",

    "Notice how much is the overhead of the data transfers as well as that of the pinned memory allocation of the `res` array. Placing your cursor on top of any of the regions in the timeline you can see more information. In this case, I have highlighted the copy-to-host operation, where you can see that the target memory on the host is pinned and the data rate is exactly as the one we have calculated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you have addressed the data transfer issues, the next step is to identify the performance bottlenecks in the most time consuming kernels. To do that, you need more detailed information that reflects hardware events happening on the GPU (e.g., instructions executed, data transferred from the main memory, use of caches etc.). To achieve this you have to pass the `--analysis-metrics` option to `nvprof` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "srun -C gpu nvprof -o vecadd.detailed.nvprof --analysis-metrics python src/vecadd.py $((200*1000*1000))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will notice this command incurs quite of an overhead. The reason behind that is that there are only a few hardware performance monitoring registers on the GPU, so in order for `nvprof` to collect all the necessary performance metrics, it will have to rerun the kernel several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this type of analysis you can obtain the actual memory bandwidth consumed by your kernel and this is what shows up for our vector addition kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Detailed profiling of the vector addition benchmark](figs/vecadd-detailed-nvprof.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected the memory bandwidth consumption is red highlighted since it is the performance limiting factor, as we have also calculated manually. The bandwidth consumption reported here is 557 GB/s, which is quite close with our measurements based on the algorithm details.\n",
